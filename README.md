# Sign Language Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains a deep learning-based implementation for sign language recognition using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The project leverages the Ultralytics library to train a custom YOLOv8 model for detecting and classifying various sign language gestures.

---

## Features
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a curated dataset of sign language gestures.
- **YOLOv8**: State-of-the-art object detection for fast and accurate predictions.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects sign language gestures in real-time through video or image inputs.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuned pre-trained YOLOv8 model for optimized performance.
